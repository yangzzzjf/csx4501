If you want hints or guidance on the basics, please post in Slack\n\n1. Join our Slack channel\n    * [click here if you need the link to join](https://join.slack.com/t/slack-rwi6743/shared_invite/zt-1batoi4rr-fTrKMVOAWFYqTOYm8bOkEQ)\n1. Make a new repository on GitHub to store assignments from this class.\n    * Go to GitHub (https://github.com) and log in. \n        * Create a GitHub account if you need one \n    * Click on \"Repositories\" and \"New\" \n    * Name your repo \"csx4501\", make it public, and select the \"Add a README file\" option\n    * Clone the new repo to your computer\n        * e.g. by using the GitHub Desktop application (https://desktop.github.com/)\n1. Copy this assignment file into the folder you just cloned.\n1. Carry out the subsequent exercises (below) in that file and save it.\n    * You will need to have Python and Jupyter installed on your computer.\n    * Contact me if you're having difficulties.\n1. Customize your repo's README file\n    * Go to the folder on your computer with the cloned files\n    * Open the README in a text editor\n    * Add a profile of yourself, a description of the course, project ideas, and your objectives for the class.\n    * Style your text\n        * Here's oneÂ [markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown) for guidance\n1. Push your completed assignment and README files to your GitHub repository\n    1. In GitHub Desktop app, make sure that the \"Current Repository\" shown at the top is your new csx4501 repository\n    1. The changed files should show up on the left.\n    1. Add a commit summary and description on the bottom-left, then click the blue Commit button.\n    1. In the main window, click the blue button \"Push origin\" to push your changed files to GitHub.\n    1. After you push successfully, verify that your files are in your GitHub repository by visiting the website for your repository\n1. Finish the assignment by submitting a link to your GitHub repository on the Canvas site","metadata":{},"id":"64e3cf6e-cf51-4531-baa3-c576b50d555b"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Python
